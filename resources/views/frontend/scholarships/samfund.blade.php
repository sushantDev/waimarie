                    Goal: To enable primary aged children who would not normally be able to participate in organized sport or cultural activities, due to financial or other constraints, the opportunity to do so, by providing equipment and/or payment of fees.</h3>
                <p>
                    It is our belief that children who are engaged in sporting or cultural activities that they enjoy from primary school age are more likely to succeed as adults and to avoid some of the pitfalls of adolescence and young adulthood if they are underemployed and under motivated. We also believe that children need the support and encouragement of caring adults in their chosen endeavours and that all children in New Zealand have access to recreational activities of their choosing.

                    Acquired funding is used to subsidise or pay fully, sports fees, music tuition fees, drama or dance class fees or other suitable cultural activity. Funding is also sought for purchase or hire of equipment or instruments.

                <p>
                    We have acquired funding from the Lions club of East Hamilton Charitable Trust to be used to subsidise or pay fully sports fees, music tuition fees, drama or dance class fees or other suitable cultural activity.

                    The $600 scholarship will be awarded to a student residing in South East Hamilton (Hamilton East, Hillcrest, Silverdale areas) and studying at the University of Waikato.                </p>

                <p>
                    The successful applicant will be required to sit on the South East Kirikiriroa Community Association – the governing body of Waimarie for a 12-month period. This will mean attending monthly meetings and maybe a planning session.                </p>

                <p>
                    Community house co-ordinator Jane Landman believes the scholarship will be a win-win for Waimarie and the scholarship recipient. “It will be good to have a university voice for the Community House,” she says. “We are also keen to recruit younger people and new members from the area.”.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The closing date is the 28th of February, 2017. To apply, fill out the following form and email it to Jane – manager@waimarie.org. Ph: (07) 858 3453. Contact her for more information.
