                <p>
                    The $600 scholarship will be awarded to a student residing in South East Hamilton (Hamilton East, Hillcrest, Silverdale areas) and studying at the University of Waikato.                </p>

                <p>
                    The successful applicant will be required to sit on the South East Kirikiriroa Community Association – the governing body of Waimarie for a 12-month period. This will mean attending monthly meetings and maybe a planning session.                </p>

                <p>
                    Community house co-ordinator Jane Landman believes the scholarship will be a win-win for Waimarie and the scholarship recipient. “It will be good to have a university voice for the Community House,” she says. “We are also keen to recruit younger people and new members from the area.”.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The closing date is the 28th of February, 2017. To apply, fill out the following form and email it to Jane – manager@waimarie.org. Ph: (07) 858 3453. Contact her for more information.
